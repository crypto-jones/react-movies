# react-movies
This is a simple web app that displays movies from the Movie Database API.

## To Run The App

If you'd like to run the app locally, `git clone` this repo. Then, `npm install` or `yarn install` in the `client` directory followed by an `npm start` or `yarn start` command in the `client` directory.

Lastly, you will have to create a `config.js` file in the `src` directory and get an API key from [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started).
